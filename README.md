# Student Loan System - Aptos Smart Contract

## Description

The **Student Loan System** is a simple decentralized finance (DeFi) application built on the Aptos blockchain. This smart contract allows students to receive loans and repay them over time using the AptosCoin (APT) token. The system consists of two main functionalities: creating loans for students and allowing repayments toward the loan. The contract ensures that students can borrow funds, and repay in parts until the total loan amount is cleared.

## Vision of the Project

The vision behind the **Student Loan System** is to provide a transparent and decentralized method for students to manage their loans and repayments. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, this system ensures that loan agreements are clear, immutable, and easily accessible. The project aims to increase financial inclusion by providing students with more accessible and secure ways to manage educational debts.

## Future Scope

While this version of the Student Loan System is basic, the project holds significant potential for future enhancements:
- **Loan Interest Rates**: Incorporating dynamic interest rates based on repayment schedules or market conditions.
- **Automatic Loan Management**: Implementing a more sophisticated repayment system where students can repay through smaller installments.
- **Credit Score Integration**: Adding functionality to track the studentâ€™s credit history and loan repayment performance.
- **Multi-token Support**: Expanding support for multiple types of tokens or other stablecoins.
- **Loan Issuance with Collateral**: Allowing students to put up collateral to receive loans or allow automatic deductions from their repayments.
